## Overview

**TEST** is a developer tool designed to provide actionable GitHub project monitoring, data validation, and automation. It focuses on integrating API testing, webhook processing, and user activity analysis into a single service to help maintainers and contributors make data-driven decisions.

This repository aims to improve repository governance and developer workflows by automating common checks and exposing endpoints for ecosystem monitoring.

---

## Features

- **API Testing** — Validates data-fetching modules for users, contributions, issues, and other GitHub resources to ensure integrations remain accurate.  
- **Webhook Handling** — Processes real-time GitHub events (issues, comments, pushes) and offers response automation.  
- **User Activity Analysis** — Aggregates activity metrics to evaluate engagement and community health.  
- **Configurable Rules** — Load governance and validation rules from YAML configuration files.  
- **Ecosystem Monitoring** — Endpoints and utilities to track recent activity across repositories.  
- **Chatbot / Command Handlers** — Command-driven helpers for maintainers to query user activity and run checks directly from comments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)  
- npm (v8+ recommended)  
- A GitHub personal access token (see usage section for required scopes)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitflicker64/test.git
````

2. Enter the project folder:

```bash
cd test
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Create a `.env` file (example shown below):

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxYOURTOKENxxx
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

> Required GitHub token scopes: `repo` (if private repos are used), `workflow`, `admin:repo_hook` or at minimum `public_repo` + `repo:status` depending on feature set. Limit scopes to what your deployment requires.

### Usage

Start the application:

```bash
npm start
```

Environment-specific start (development):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Common endpoints and CLI utilities:

* `/health` — service health check
* `/webhook` — GitHub webhook receiver
* `/api/users/:username/activity` — user activity summary (example)

Adjust routes and handlers in `src/` as required.

### Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

(Replace `{test_framework}` with the configured framework; e.g., Jest, Mocha.)

If tests require CI or GitHub mocks, configure `GITHUB_TOKEN` and test fixtures before running.
